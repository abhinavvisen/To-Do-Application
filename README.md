# To-Do-Application

A To do application which allows user keep track of what he wants to do after as he opens his Browser.Its a basic application in Node js.I am trying to add more advanced features.Any type of suggestion is most welcome.After loading angular.min.js we create an Angular JS module called todoApp and a controller called todoController. Inside the controller we set up an empty array called tasks that will hold the todo list. We make it an attribute of the current $scope in order to make it accessible form the HTML.
